# Background

Python was my first programming language. In 2025, I wanted to pay tribute to Python for making the beginning of my programming journey wonderful by doing some time travel. Well, let's just assume it's possible, in an ideal world. I'm going to go back to my past self when I started learning Python. 👇

In ordinary human language, I want to give back to the community by making a simple, and easily understandable collection of examples accessible for beginners in Programming and Computer Science / Engineering. Hopefully this will encourage more people to take up programming and realise the fun and potential to improve the world that this discipline and art brings. ✨
